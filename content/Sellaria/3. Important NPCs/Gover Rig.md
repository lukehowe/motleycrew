Gover Rig
Protector of the King
[[Crua Clye]]

Gover Rig was born in the tents that would become [[Craterholm, Crua Clye]] just a couple of years before the impact of the Sandcrater to a healthy mother, and an ill father, who was beginning to lose his ability to walk. After their separation, Rig's mother took her boy to Jaiross, the Royal Capital where she scrounged coin to put Gover into sword-training school. His mother passed when he was 15, and by 18, Rig was sent to Nohull to join the City Guard. By 29, Rig was the Captain of the Nohull City Guard.Â 

Since interacting with the [[Motley Crew]], Gover has lost his city to mind flayers and been swept into a movement to secure the boy King [[King Kayron Jaiross|Kayron]] and re-take their country. He has spent several weeks with the boy king, seeing himself as a father figure to the young man, showing him swordplay and attempting to ensure the king is learning about the world. He has great respect for [[Vorax]], who blessed his father and allowed him to walk once again.
