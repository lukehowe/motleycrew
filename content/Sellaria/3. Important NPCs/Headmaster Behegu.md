Headmaster Behegu (DECEASED)
Ex-headmaster of the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon|Uchon Institute of Learning]]
[[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon]]


Headmaster Benkirk Behegu is a human man in his young 50s. Behegu, a selfish and greedy man, devised a plan to find himself more powerful than ever before. He contracted a small time bandit group from [[Consteltown, Crua Clye]] called the [[Gold Tear Gang]] to raid and storm the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]], causing havoc, killing, and stealing magic items. 

Soon after the raid, Headmaster Behegu started pushing policies of stronger securities and more strict control of magic items. With a sense of fear among the school, the headmaster gained strong support. 

Knowing that [[Farpip Darkback]] has been missing since the raid, and assuming he is trying to learn who is behind the raid, has started spreading rumors about [[Farpip Darkback||Pip]] amongst the current class of students, such that [[Farpip Darkback||Pip]] is a dropout, unintelligent, and has been expelled from the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]] for illegal activities such as treason.  

Most recently, Behegu has once again contracted the [[Gold Tear Gang]] to attack once again. The plot was foiled by the [[Motley Crew]] and he was ultimately killed in that battle.
