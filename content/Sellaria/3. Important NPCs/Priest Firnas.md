Priest Firnas
Priest of Trithereon
Location unknown.

Priest Firnas is a gold Dragonborn who was in the city of [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]] when the party arrived. He was the one to resurrect [[Bluz]] with a Scroll of Resurrection from his father after the [[Nohull, Crua Clye|Nohull]] Survey Device incident. From there on, [[Vorax]] worked closely with Firnas, helping him and [[Lydie Holyspell]] construct the new church being built on the mountain under [[King Kayron Jaiross]]'s recently new priviledge for any church to be present in the capital.
