Paeris Ianric, The Maker, Inventor of Froiji
Member of the [[Circle of Dragonriders]]
[[Froiji Supremacy]]

The [[Motley Crew]] saw Paeris flying on Erdin some time before their arrival to the [[Glowsky Shoulder, Uchon]].

As the party explored the Breadbasket, they began to hear of Drones.

During the Raid on the [[Glowsky Shoulder, Uchon||Glowsky Shoulder]], the party began to hear of 'The Maker', and learned within his workshop that Paeris Ianric was creating these drones through torturing the slaves of the Breadbasket.

During this battle, Paeris Ianric attacked atop his dragon. His dragon was slain, and he crash landed off the coast of the [[Glowsky Shoulder, Uchon||Shoulder]], facing attacks by the [[Motley Crew]]. His dragon told him to ride another dragon now that he has fallen. 

He then somehow managed to teleport away to safely.
