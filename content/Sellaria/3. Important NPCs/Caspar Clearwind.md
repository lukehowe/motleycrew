Caspar Clearwind
Friend of the [[Motley Crew]]
[[Wheatvil, Crua Clye]]

Caspar landed in [[Wheatvil, Crua Clye]] with the [[Motley Crew]] in 1500 A.B. After entering the Sun Tower with the party and almost dying immediately, he's since settled down in the town.

He has sent a letter to the [[Motley Crew]] telling them that he has met a woman and is settling down and starting a family there. He says he is proud to say that he was there among the Crew in their early days.
