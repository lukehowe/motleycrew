Dechar
Priest of Trithereon
[[Westbridge, Crua Clye]] / [[Ablus Highway Ruins, Crua Clye]]

Dechar was recruited by the [[Motley Crew]] to be a preacher for the [[Holy Army of Trithereon]] when they arrived to [[Westbridge, Crua Clye]] for the second time, killing the Neothelid. He spent his youth preaching and claims to have had visions of leading this army of goblins, of some kind.
