Boron
Captain of the [[Mosquitos]]
[[Crua Clye]]

Boron has had an interesting history with the [[Motley Crew]]. An original enemy, before the party came to know that he and his men were being controlled by the [[Illithilich]], but now an ally. Boron is motivated to retrieve the [[Royal Meteorite Longsword of Mayron]], as it should likely be Boron's, as he and the [[Mosquitos]] were the ones to defeat the cosmic monsters in the crater of the Sandcrater.

Leader of the [[Mosquitos]]. Wields [[Armor of Boron]].
