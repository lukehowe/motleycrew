Lydie Holyspell
Cleric of Trithereon, Ex-Member of [[Black Company]]
Location unknown.

Lydie Holyspell was on the Fireball in 1500 A.B. along with the [[Motley Crew]] and the [[Black Company]] when they landed in [[Wheatvil, Crua Clye]]. She seemed to be uncomfortable with the immoral party, and eventually confided in [[Vorax]] the [[Black Company]]'s plan to sabotage the [[Motley Crew]].

After the skirmish between [[Nohull, Crua Clye]] and [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]], Lydie joins the [[Motley Crew]] on the way to the capital. There, she ultimately finds [[Priest Firnas]] and begins helping him and [[Vorax]] build the new Church of Trithereon in [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]].
