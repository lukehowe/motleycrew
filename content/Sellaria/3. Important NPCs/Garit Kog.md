Garit Kog
Contractor/Mercenary for the [[Red Flame]]

Garit Kog is an older Elven mercenary that was once known as a ruthless assassin and thief. In 1497, he was once hired to attack Zubar Cammol in [[Frontiertown, Crua Clye|Frontiertown]], and let him live.Â 

More recently, however, due to his reputation, Garit Kog was taken on by the [[Red Flame]] to be a contractor. From here, it was discovered that he hired several mercenaries to attempt to discover entrances to the [[Glimmersea|Underdark]]. After hearing of the Pit Lake Incident, Kog began sending mercenaries towards [[Nohull, Crua Clye|Nohull]]. 

Soon after, the [[Motley Crew]] discovered Garit Kog beneath the Tax Hall in [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]]. He was killed.

Sometime after the Fortune Comet Collision, Kog has been seemingly resurrected, now with new psionic abilities...?
