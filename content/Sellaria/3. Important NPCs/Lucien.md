Lucien
Leader of the [[Ghosts of Jaiross]]
[[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]]

Originally one of [[King Kayron Jaiross]]'s closest advisors from within the [[Royal Army]], who served with the [[Motley Crew]] during the time of [[Bluz]]'s passing. Following the Comet Collision, he was ordered by the [[Motley Crew]] to gather remnants of the [[Royal Army]] from under the noses of the [[Froiji Supremacy]], to gather strength for the army that would take back [[Crua Clye]] from the [[Froiji Supremacy]]. He has since significantly grown the [[Ghosts of Jaiross]] from the destroyed capital, with outreach to nearby cities, also boosting their reach with the help of the [[Golden Lyre]].
