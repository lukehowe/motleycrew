<< name unknown >>

This creature fled from its home, possibly the [[Mythqua Mind Flayers]]. From there, he took control of the [[Mosquitos]] and used the faction to lift and steal the Meteorite Artifacts from around [[Crua Clye]] and collect them. From there he became a lich, likely learning the ritual from [[Rhuxus]]. He was shortly thereafter seen riding a Cosmic Dragon.

It now appears there are mind flayers flocking to join the Illithilich's rule. It also seems there is an Elder Brain he controls now.
