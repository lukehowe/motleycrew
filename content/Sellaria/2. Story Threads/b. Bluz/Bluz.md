**Calm the Wave**
1. During the night, the [[Crimson Marauders]], [[Drex]], and I were attacked by the [[Crashing Wave Clan]]. I memorized the voice of their leader, [[Plux]]. Where is [[Plux]]?
 2. I came across [[Gnatface]], a lieutenant in the [[Crashing Wave Clan]] in [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]]. My friends stole his diamond and resurrected me and we went back and defeated him, and jailed him. However, during the Comet Collision, he escaped. Where did he go?
 3. There is still many a goblin slave held within the Crashing Wave Cove in the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon]]. How can I rescue these goblins?

**Claiming Freedom**
5. I arrived in [[Verdantstead, Uchon]] and started a massive rebellion. We moved westward to [[Meadowbrook, Uchon]], where Trithereon smiled upon us and blessed us with victory. We then moved westward to [[Glowsky Shoulder, Uchon]], where I defeated Panfer Glowsky. All that is left is [[Seedville, Uchon]] and [[Cropshire, Uchon]].

**Finding a Friend**
3. In the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon]], I found the original cabin I was sold in. It appeared as if the slaves had gained some control for some time, and found a message scrawled into the floorboard by [[Drex]] saying he was being taken to [[Strale, Froiji Supremacy]] to meet Paeris Ianric, the Maker. I need to get to [[Strale, Froiji Supremacy]].

## Backstory
Bluz lived a happy life raiding villages with his brethren in the [[Crimson Marauders]] in the [[]]. Specifically, he and his friend [[Drex]] shared a bond over their exploits and riches gained. One night, he and his family set up camp in a field. In the early morning, just as the sun's purple and oranges were beginning to beat the horizon, chaos hit. Within seconds, the camp was being overwhelmed with a hostile goblin force. In the chaos, [[Drex]] disappeared, and Bluz quickly found himself being jumped on by four different enemies. As he was being hogtied, Bluz looked up and saw that banner showcasing a large blue wave splashing down - the [[Crashing Wave Clan]], a ruthless Goblin gang that would capture anybody they can. Within the following days, Bluz was thrown into a push cart on top of several other goblinoid prisoners. When the [[Crashing Wave Clan]] stopped for camp, Bluz could hear the voice of one goblin man, distinctly scratchy and hard on the ear, making commands to the others. Through the days, Bluz was able to make out his name - [[Plux]], the leader of the clan. 

Within a sevenday, the cart was eventually taken to a remote shack still in the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon]], where a crowd of Halflings had gathered to buy Bluz and his friends. A halfling man named Ulfer Glowsky won the auction on Bluz, who ran high due to his bodily strength. Ulfer chained Bluz and took him home, several hours away from the remote location. 

On an excruciatingly hot day, one of the younger slaves began to suffer from heat exhaustion and collapsed. Ulfer mocked and spit on the young goblin, and becoming enraged, Bluz lashed out and attempted to attack Ulfer. After some wrestling, Ulfer’s men pulled Bluz off. Ulfer decided to make an example of what happens in the face of defiance, and brutally beat and humiliated Bluz. Bluz, horribly beaten and barely able to speak looked Ulfer in the eyes and swore he would one day kill him and his sick brother for what they had done. That is where his plot to escape began. 

 In the month (year) that Bluz was enslaved, he developed an insatiable lust for adventure, freedom, status, and wealth that culminated in him planning an escape.  

After finding a way to break free from his manacles one night, Bluz grabbed his pitchfork, broke into Ulfer's home, and murdered him in his sleep. He took his captor's heirloom sword and armor, geared up with some simple supplies from around the house, and began following the ocean down to [[Starhaven, Uchon]] to catch a boat to flee to [[Crua Clye]].
