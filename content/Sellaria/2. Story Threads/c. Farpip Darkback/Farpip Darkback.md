**Harnessing the Weave**
2. After arriving in [[Consteltown, Crua Clye]] and discovering the [[Gold Tear]], I entered the Weave Realm. It seems natural, undisturbed, magical artifacts could be the gateway. Where is more of these artifacts?

**Cleansing the Institute**
7. Exploring the [[Sylvandelta, Uchon||Sylvandelta]], I found a desecrated cave that Behegu would visit that held an altar that would steal/teleport magical items that made contact with it. The cave also displayed a projection of Demogorgon, a demon prince. How is it connected?

**Harnessing the Weave**
1. My master Adrugeor told me he hypothesized that the Weave Realm, a subplane of the Material consisting of raw arcane energy, could be traversable. ~~But what was the key?~~

**Cleansing the Institute**
1. The [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]] was attacked by a group of raiders, including two twin Half-Orcs, who were all searching for an Efreeti Bottle. ~~Why?~~
2. I met Raslin Silvergem in [[Treecrater, Crua Clye]], a student who mentioned Xanovar, a supposed graduate student that held a strong hatred for the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]]. ~~Could he be behind the attacks?~~
3. I met Xanovar in [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]], tipping me off to [[Zane Redstream]], leader of the [[Gold Tear Gang]]. Where could he be?
4. In [[Craterholm, Crua Clye]], I was killed by Board of Magical Security wizards from the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]]. ~~Why does the Institute want me dead?~~
5. In [[Consteltown, Crua Clye]], I learned that the [[Gold Tear Gang]] was hiding underneath the city, and discovered that there was a second attack being planned against the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]]. [[Headmaster Behegu]] was planning the attacks with the [[Gold Tear Gang]] to gain more control over the magical items at the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]]. He wanted me dead because I was close to uncovering his secrets. I defeated [[Zane Redstream]], Zeeazz, and the Half Orc Twins in battle, and learned that [[Headmaster Behegu]] was behind the false-flag attacks. ~~Can I catch the army before they arrive to the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]]?~~
6. Arriving at the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]], the Second Battle for the Institute was underway. I rushed in and defeated the [[Gold Tear Gang]] and [[Headmaster Behegu]]. The [[Illithilich]] also attacked, stealing the Magma Compass, which leads to the hottest place on the Material Plane. In Adrugeor's office, I found an unfinished letter addressed to the Popular Emissary of [[Uchon]] detailing suspcions of the Headmaster travelling to the [[Sylvandelta, Uchon||Sylvandelta]] frequenty. ~~What could be there?~~

## Backstory
Farpip was an apprentice of Adrugeor at the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]]. One day, Farpip was studying in the Grand Library. He heard shouts and screaming coming from somewhere else in the Institute, so he ran. Whilst running, Farpip was attacked by two twin half orc brothers. Farpip was able to get himself away from his attackers and hide beneath a large bookshelf in the great hall. For  10 or 15 minutes of hiding, Farpip could hear the sounds of destruction and horror as students and teachers were slaughtered, before several attackers entered the great hall. Farpip overheard one of them say, "The Efreeti Bottle wasn't here, but at least we got away with this. We need to get back to [[Consteltown, Crua Clye||Consteltown]]. Now." However, Farpip was unable to see what the attackers were talking about. Shortly after, they departed the Institute. Moments later, Farpip found his mentor, Adrugeor, slain by the attackers.  

Pip left the mess behind him, and moved forward to chase down the attackers. He caught the next ship out of [[Uchon]], which happened to be a fishing ship royally chartered to carry caravan guard applicants to [[Crua Clye]], where [[Consteltown, Crua Clye]] is.
