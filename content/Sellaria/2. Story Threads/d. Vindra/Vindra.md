**Finding My Voice**
6. The requests of the townspeople of [[Craterholm, Crua Clye]] requested that we get to the top of Cloudclimb Cave and defeat the Rocs that were terrorizing their city. When we made it through the cave, which held undead, we found [[Katar]] and Oog. Within was [[Rhuxus]]'s old lair, which was recently abandoned. He left a massive Nightstalker to kill anybody who tracked him there. After clearing it out, we found personalized messages from [[Rhuxus]] on the wall, taunting the [[Motley Crew]]. Who is this lich?
7. When the [[Motley Crew]] and I parted ways with [[Katar]] and Oog to fight with [[Clan Tigfum]], by the time we arrived back to [[Craterholm, Crua Clye]], there was no sign of [[Katar]] and Oog. Where did they go?

**Undead Spotting**
1. A [[Emissary's Update (Verdantstead)||news bulletin]] in [[Verdantstead, Uchon]] claimed that Undead had been spotted in the Breadbasket, coming north from the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon]]. It seems there is a mass migration of sorts, all from Cloudclimb Cave, south... towards... [[Wae Esari, Uchon]]...?

4. I found Rose Cartwright in [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]].

5. I arrived in [[Craterholm, Crua Clye]], and found the inn room that belonged to [[Katar]] and Oog. They left a note and signal that they had been there, saying they left to explore. ~~Where could they be?~~

## Backstory
Vindra was 16 years old when he was playing in the forests of [[Wae Esari, Uchon]], his home village. He heard a gurgling noise and peeked around a tree trunk to find a zombie shambling towards him. Just as the zombie closed in on him, an arrow went straight through the side of the undead's head. Standing just to the left on a small rock was a wood elf holding a large, beautifully crafted bow. Along with the wood elf, whom Vindra learned was named [[Katar]], was a female human named Rose Cartwright, a male kenku named Spade Dig, and a male apefolk named Oog. Their party was called The [[Voice of the Reticent]]. They escorted Vindra back to his village proper, where when they arrived, a horde of undead had come upon the town. The Voice fought back against the undead, ultimately ending their raid. In the days following, Vindra hung around the [[Voice of the Reticent]] while they helped rebuild [[Wae Esari, Uchon]]. Katar told him stories of battling an army of the undead called the [[Everlasting Legion]]. One morning, Katar and his teammates left the village, and Vindra never saw them again.Â 

Vindra grew up idolizing [[Katar]], and eventually became a ranger because of his influence. Now, Vindra is searching for [[Katar]], perhaps to thank him for his help.
