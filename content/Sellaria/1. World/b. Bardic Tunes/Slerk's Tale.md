Written by Arthur Cleves about [[Slerk]], a fallen member of the [[Motley Crew]].

In the realm of shadows, where goblins dwell, 
A tale of Slerk, I'm here to tell, 
Once a slave, in chains he'd roam, 
But destiny would shape his home. 

With shackles bound, Slerk toiled hard, 
In the mines, beneath the shard, 
But his spirit burned, a fire untamed, 
A warrior's heart, no fear remained. 

In a daring rescue, he broke free, 
From servitude and misery, 
Slerk, a goblin reborn, with strength anew, 
To face the world, he'd boldly pursue. 

He trained and fought, a fierce campaign, 
Battling foes and facing pain, 
Slerk rose as a hero, his legend grew, 
A goblin warrior, courageous and true. 

Yet destiny's whims, a fickle game, 
In the shadow of a dragon's flame, 
A fierce red wyrm, a deadly foe, 
Their battle fought, with a final blow. 

Our hero Slerk, he fell that day, 
In a crimson clash, his life gave way, 
But his legacy lives, in song and tale, 
A warrior's spirit, that shall not fail. 

He never learned the bongo's beat, 
Or danced in halls, with nimble feet, 
But in the heart of all who knew his name, 
Slerk's courage burns, an eternal flame. 

So raise your voices, let the story be told, 
Of Slerk, the goblin warrior, brave and bold, 
In the annals of time, his legend drums, 
A hero's spirit, forever hums.
