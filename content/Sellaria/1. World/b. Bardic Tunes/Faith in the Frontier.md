Written by an unknown bard about the [[Motley Crew]]'s involvement with [[Frontiertown, Crua Clye]] in 1500 A.B.

(Verse 1) 
In shadows deep, a town in despair,  
A deadly grip, drugs everywhere.  
Heroes emerged, a motley band,  
To break the spell, they took a stand. 

(Chorus)  
Oh, the town was lost in the grip of vice,  
But heroes emerged, breaking the ice. 

(Verse 2)  
A ranger, a mage, a knight so true,  
They faced the darkness, the dangers grew.  
Through alleys dark, a goblin crept,  
 They fought with valor, and courage kept. 

(Chorus)  
Oh, the town was lost in the grip of vice,  
But heroes emerged, breaking the ice. 

(Bridge)  
In shadows defeated, hope took flight, 
 The adventurers vowed to end the blight.  
With dawn's embrace, the town awoke, 
 From the nightmare's grasp, the heroes spoke. 

(Outro)  
Now a thriving town, in the sun's warm glow, 
A tale of redemption, the bards now sow. 
 From despair to joy, a triumphant dive,  
In the heart of the people, the adventurers thrive.
