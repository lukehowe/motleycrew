Ethereal Rain

A 3 day colorful meteor shower leading up to the passing of the Fortune Comet on the 4th day. It happens every 20 years.Â 

In the year 1500 A.B., the Meteorite Artifacts of Crua Clye were all stolen, and the [[Ethereal Rain]] culimated in the massive Fortune Comet crashing down into central [[Crua Clye]] causing massive damage. Soon thereafter, a white skinned illithid ([[Illithilich]]) was seen flying atop a Cosmic Dragon, wearing robes as if the view was looking through a glass pane into outer space.

After being fought off by some Dragons from [[Froiji Supremacy]], he fled, but still one more Cosmic Dragon remained slumbering within the massive crater left behind by the Fortune Comet.
