A young, free, and diverse nation, plagued by bad luck in its ruling family.

In 1278 A.B., Kyron Jaiross was named king after the City of Clye (Eastbridge) was founded. He announced the construction of the Great Bridge and Crua (Westbridge). He saw the Meteorite of Treecrater fall with the [[Ethereal Rain]] around 1300 A.B., inspiring him to write that the Jaiross House needed to move westward. The meteorite's collision brought stellar monsters that [[Ziod-Kaz]] was able to defeat. He then forged his sword and armor out of the meteorite shards left by the meteorite. He and his tribe lived in the crater afterwards until [[Ziod-Kaz]] died.

The following ancestors of Kyron moved the kingdom westward, watching meteorites fall as they did. 

The Grasscrater was created by a rogue meteorite offÂ  of an [[Ethereal Rain]] passing in the year 1460. The meteorite's collision was said to have brought small stellar spores that an elf Royal Soldier named Gormon defeated with his longbow from the top of Castle Stormwatch. King Baygal Jaiross's reward was to have the [[Meteorite Longbow of Gormon|Meteorite Longbow]] crafted for Gormon. Gormom died in 1465 due to a tragic illness where his body grew in places it shouldn't have.

The Sandcrater was created by a rogue meteorite off of an [[Ethereal Rain]] passing in the year 1480. One of Bayron's first acts as king was the commissioning of the [[Royal Meteorite Longsword of Mayron]] (his son) after a group of fighters defeated the "stellar monsters" that came with the meteorite. Following the suicide of Bayron and the untimely deaths of his two sons, the longsword was stolen from [[Craterholm, Crua Clye|Craterholm]] by the [[Mosquitos]], the group of fighters that had defeated the stellar monsters. They were then a bandit group that has been taken control by the Illithilich.

Baygal Jaiross (1420-1500 A.B.), the late grandfather of the now [[King Kayron Jaiross]], gave the throne to his son, Bayron, after becoming ill in 1480 A.B.

Bayron Jaiross (1460-1490 A.B.) shielded his children from the lessons of ruling. He commissioned [[Okirk]], the famous Meteorite Smith, to forge the [[Royal Meteorite Longsword of Mayron|Royal Meteorite Longsword]] for his son Mayron in 1480 A.B., but the sword was ultimately stolen before it could be finished. Threw himself from the top of Crag Keep soon after the sickly death of his wife, [[King Kayron Jaiross]]'s mother.

From this point forward, the weak Baygal Jaiross ruled in the place of his son and grandsons, until they became of age.

Mayron & Layron Jaiross (1478-1493 A.B.), the twin brothers of [[King Kayron Jaiross|Kayron]], perished at each other's hands following what only could have been an argument regarding the death of their father. After this event, Baygal Jaiross gave the throne to Kayron, the last living Jaiross, and began attempting to teach his grandson how to rule.

In the year 1500 A.B., following the death of Baygal Jaiross, [[King Kayron Jaiross]] was then the last Jaiross to rule. A few months later, the ship 'Fireball' carrying what would become the [[Motley Crew]] landed in the country.
