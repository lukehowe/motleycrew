A halfling-native country.

Halflings from Eshia discovered the fertile soil of the Breadbasket in Uchon in 1211 A.B. Eshia natives flood the peninsula, landing in Cropshire, ultimately making them the majority of the population of the country. They begin kidnapping from the Goblin Fields for slaves.
