## Overview
The Duergar city of Anvil rests on a huge plateau above a lake of the [[Glimmersea]]. It is built out of stone by the early members of Clan Duergar. It has been carved out and turned into a majestic stone city. There are several large square shaped towers and keeps built from the stone. Large, massive stone walls wrap around the city, with guard tower boxes regularly spaced out. On this thin land bridge, only thirty or forty feet wide, the water under the bridge in this cove envelops the space with a dark blue color. The archietecture of the city is by no means pretty, but it is jaw dropping because of its scale. There are execution blocks on every other corner in this city.

## The Land
A long land bridge connects the plateau city to the mainland. A large cliff face stands on the opposite side, where a tunnel leading to other parts of the Underdark once was. It has recently disappeared.

## The Leadership
Ruled by a council of petty duergar princes who have been trying to elect a High King for over a decade. They are each descendants from prominent House Duergar families. They are all deadlocked in their own favor for High King. Each prince believes that they are the rightful heir to the throne and the kingdom is now plagued by political maneuvering, backstabbing, and even open conflict as the different factions seek to undermine their rivals and promote their own claim.Â  The streets of Anvil are filled with intrigue, as spies and assassins lurk in the shadows and rumors of secret alliances and deals circulate. Despite their cunning and strength, the duergar princes have been unable to overcome their differences and choose a new king.
