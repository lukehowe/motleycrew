## Overview
The majority of the buildings in this village consist of semi-spherical stone huts with open doors. There are no true pathways or roads for the city, but the huts seem to be aligned in a street-like manner. There is one large stone building on one end of the settlement where the tribe meets. A small canoe of drow floats away from the shore and village and out onto the lake.

## The Land
Warm and damp. This lake is dangerous and difficult to traverse without a guide: its waters are treacherous, its currents strange and deadly, and monsters roam its depts.  

At the bottom of the lake, there are steam vents, so the water is slightly warm. There is a lot of evaporation that creates clouds of fog that reduce visibility. The vapour collects at the top of the cave where it cools down and regularly turns into rain. This rain is safe to drink, water from the lake is safe only for locals. The rain can also make it hard to navigate for people that aren't ready. Food is easy to find: fish is plentiful if you know how to catch it, and on the shores, there are plenty of plants and small animals. In the lake, there is a unique race of fishes that produce light, they swim in a large school right below the surface producing a trail of light, the only natural light in the entire cave other than the ceiling.

## The People
A small city of mainly Drow that abandoned [[Kitji-Naal, Glimmersea|Kitji-Naal]] and Lolth long ago. There is a tribe living on the lake shores, they trade fish with outsiders, found only here and quite expensive for collectors, and pearls. They are the only ones able to traverse the lake. Going through here can save a lot of time travelling in the Underdark, as it connects various different cave systems. This is a tribe of drows, they abandoned Lolth a long time ago, and now live in a simpler society. They sell fish and pearls, that here can reach the size of a capibara. They dress is light clothes, live in stone huts, wear tattoos. Pretty cool guys all around. If paid, they can teach foreigners the basics of surviving the lake, but they aren't really keen on long trips on it. They have limited people who know how to sail on it.  these people are strange, they can be friendly but turn aggressive rapidly.
