## Overview
Craterholm is a relatively new city. It was originally a gathering of tents and traders, known as a type of marketplace. Fish from the Gulf of Storms were traded here, along with manufactured goods from Westbridge. 

20 years ago, in the year of 1480, after the collision of the meteorite that created Sandcrater, which landed just next to this trading spot, [[King Kayron Jaiross|Kayron]]'s father Bayron ruled that a city should be constructed in/around this crater, partially to bolster the growth of this marketplace, and partially to ensure the materials from the meteor be harvested for the kingdom. However, when the meteorite collided, it fragmented, sending small pieces of meteorite everywhere. Even to this day, small pieces of the fragments can be found within the marketplaces of Craterholm. 

Some buildings were constructed from blocks of sandstone dug from quarries around the city. However, the majority of the city's shelter comes from large tents and  awnings. The city is still mainly a marketplace, however it is now a permanent home to some. Craterholm is still more of a rest stop for a lot of travellers, as it is the first western city past the Twincities.

Following the Crash of the Fortune Comet, the city was overran by Froiji Supremacy. Its inhabitants fled westward, running into the [[Mosquitos]].

## The Land
Craterholm rests in the middle of the arid, eastern half of Crua Clye. Before the collision of the meteorite that made Sandcrater, the land was flat. Now, however, there is a large crater that is essentially the middle point of the city. Most of the buildings funded by the King found themselves down in this crater, such as housing, whereas the real heart of the city is still the marketplace - all of the trading tents and booths surrounding it.
