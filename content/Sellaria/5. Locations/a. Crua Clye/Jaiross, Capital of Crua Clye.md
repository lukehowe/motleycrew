## Overview
Jaiross, the Royal Capital of Crua Clye, was founded in the year 350 by grandfather Baymal Jaiross, of the current ruler (1500 A.B.), [[King Kayron Jaiross]]. The castle's construction was finished just three years before the death of Baymal. The city itself was constructed on top of several fresh water streams that run out of the mountain, providing water for the people of the city. The surrounding city came together quickly as the citizens of [[Crua Clye]] migrated to the new country capital.

Following the Comet Collision, a majority of the city was destroyed, as it was also raided by [[Froiji Supremacy]] and [[Red Flame]].
## The Land
Jaiross is nestled in the mountains between the intersections of the Northern, Western, and Eastern Royal Peaks. There are only three paths into the city, from the baselines of each of these mountains. A long, winding, cobblestone road leads up to the capital city. The air is crisp, with a slight chill in the air. When the wind blows through the mountain peaks, the cold can be felt.

## The Leadership
The leader of [[Crua Clye]] is a king by the name of [[King Kayron Jaiross]], who is a 20 year old male human. He is the son of Bayron Jaiross, a king who found himself in a rather inactive period of the country. Bayron garnered a hatred for the throne, and grew depressed, unwanting to rule. Due to this, Kayron grew up not experiencing a lot of the politics of the throne. As a boy, Kayron was more intrigued with the life of a knight, and he trained with weapons and armor accordingly. When Kayron was 9, his mother passed due to illness. One day, when Kayron was about 10 years old, Bayron threw himself from the top of the Throne Room one day when his depression won. 3 years later, when Kayron was 13, his two eldest twin brothers dueled each other over a private argument they had regarding the death of their father. They both slayed each other, leaving Kayron the youngest living Jaiross and the new king of Crua Clye. His grandfather Baygal counseled him until his recent death earlier this year.
