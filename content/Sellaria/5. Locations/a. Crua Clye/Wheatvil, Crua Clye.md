Wheatvil, [[Crua Clye]]
Allies: [[Royal Army]]
Key Figures: Caspar Clearwind, Royal Caravan Advisor Aeson Gromley ([[Royal Army]]), Captain Munn ([[Royal Army]])

## Overview
Wheatvil is a medium sized farming village that was founded early on in Crua Clye's lifetime. When early explorers first adventured southwest, they found a forest full of fertile soil. This is where Wheatvil began. The city was planned to be the food backbone of the country. Within weeks, the first cabins went up, and within months, the fields began to expand. Several founding families started the wheat farms. Present day, Wheatvil pumps out thousands of pounds of grain and wheat to be used for food in the land of Crua Clye.

The [[Motley Crew]] landed here in 1500 A.B, beginning a scuffle with their rivals, the [[Black Company]].

## The Land
Wheatvil lies south of a large, rushing river that originates somewhere in the Dark Forest. There are two bridges that lead to Wheatvil from the north and northeast. The dirt in the plains below the large western forest of Crua Clye is full of fertilizer and nutrients that stimulates the growth of wheat. For this reason, the field turned into an ocean of wheat to feed the people of the country.

## The Leadership
Royal Caravan Advisor Aeson Gromley is often in Wheatvil, maintaining the status of the Royal Caravan that delivers the harvested foodstuff from Wheatvil. He oversees the routes that the caravan takes, and also pays mind to the amount of wheat that needs to be harvested in order to feed the people of the country.Â 

When Aeson is not in Wheatvil, there is often a squad of Royal Knights guarding the country, as it is a governmental asset.
