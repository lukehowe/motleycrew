## Overview
Frontiertown is a quiet, shady village that has been around for several decades. It began as a checkpoint/camp that laid on the very edge of Crua Clye, right next to the unexplored expanse of Dark Forest to its west.  

Frontiertown was once a great adventuring checkpoint where brave adventurers would stop before travelling into the Dark Forest to the west. 

 Year after year, the city began to grow, and eventually there was several residential houses within the village. Most recently, a tavern, the Crowded Snapdragon, opened up, and all types of crooks begin to appear within the city. Ever since then, the town has had recent crime, due to the underfunding from the corrupt Cabinet of the King.  

When the [[Motley Crew]] arrived in 1500 A.B., the town was infested with drugs, but shortly after their arrival, the massive druglord Zubar Cammol was defeated.

## The Land
Frontiertown is in the northwest corner of Clua Clye, south of the mountains that create the border between the country and the Froiji Supremacy, and east of the unexplored expanse of dense trees that make up the Dark Forest.  Frontiertown is surrounded by sparse spruce trees that raise high into the sky. The dirt around this village is moist. There are two roads leaving the village, one heading east towards the Pit Lake and [[Nohull, Crua Clye|Nohull by the Lake]], and one heading south towards [[Wheatvil, Crua Clye|Wheatvil]].

## Criminals
There is a skin-absorbed mixture of herbs that give a euphoric and hallucinogenic high called 'Sunburn'. The skin where the mixture is rubbed into turns a bright orange color, mimicking a sunburn. The high lasts for 5-6 hours.

Zubar Cammol was the druglord who was caught by the [[Motley Crew]] and then killed by a beholderkin beneath the city.
