## Overview
Nohull by the Lake is a city near the capital of Crua Clye. It was founded more recently in the country's history; however, it quickly became and has remained an important city in Crua Clye's societal ecosystem. After the first two or three [[Ethereal Rain]]s, the city's history says that a group of well-learned thinkers crafted the Yird Viewscope, a large, metallic building that houses a powerful telescope within the top of it. From there, despite the like-named [[Consteltown, Crua Clye|Consteltown]], Nohull became the number one city for astral plane research.

Leading up to the Fortune Comet Crash, [[Mythqua Mind Flayers]] began to attack the city, focusing on the Astronomer's Center. Xodon Bellydwadle was able to piece together that the flayers were motivated by something other than eating brains.

## The Leadership
The city, manned by a City Watch, listens to the Crown for governing, however, the city does contain a council made up of three family elites. They make the decisions that do not require the crown. The members are voted in and can serve for up to 20 years. The Council commands the Watch, led by [[Gover Rig]].
