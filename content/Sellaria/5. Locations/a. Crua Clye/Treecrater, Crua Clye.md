Treecrater, [[Crua Clye]]
Allies: [[Royal Army]]
Key Figures: Ladorre Orrina (Manager of the Museum of Fortune), Raslin Silvergem (Intern at the Museum of Fortune)

## Overview
The house that sits in the bottom of the Treecrater is called The Museum of Fortune. It holds different items that are related to the [[Ethereal Rain]] and the Fortune Comet. The Museum of Fortune holds the [[Meteorite Longsword of Ziod-Kaz]], which was stolen in the heist that happened within a fortnight of the party arriving to the museum. Along with the longsword, several fragments of the meteorite were stolen. The rest of the Mueseum holds information and the gear of the legendary human [[Ziod-Kaz]], a brave, courageous hero that lived during the time of the Treecrater strike.Â 

The cabin next to the museum was once the house of [[Ziod-Kaz]], but now, Raslin and Ladorre reside within the cabin and take care of the museum.

## The Land
The landscape of Treecrater is dense, lush forestry surrounding the large crater in the ground. There is light foliage growing within the curved walls of the crater. In the very middle of the crater where it begins to even out, there is a large wooden building with columns with a small cabin next to it.
