## Overview
The magical college where [[Farpip Darkback]] is from.

## The Land
The Uchon Institute of Learning is built at the base of Spell Lake, a clearwater lake that is said to house plentiful schools of magical fish that provide several potion ingredients. The mystical [[Sylvandelta, Uchon|Sylvandelta]] is a large forested delta off of Goldwater Rush that is said to be passively affected by some kind of magic. Some students travel to this delta to duel. 

Aside from the cliffside coast to the west, the land around the Institute is a bit hilly, but mostly just grassy plains.

## The People
The Institute was ran by a Headmaster (currently Headmaster Behegu), as well as several different Boards that monitor/control other parts of the school (i.e. Board of Magical Security).

There is also about a hundred professors that teach all kinds of different subject matters at the Institute. Beneath them is a few thousand mages that are studying arcana. A small group called the [[Arcane Autonomy]] as popped up from these mages that are catching on to the manipulative and evil actions that the headmaster is taking against them, and rallied to [[Farpip Darkback]] when he arrived at the Institute.

## The Leadership
The Institute is led by a Headmaster who was elected by a popular vote from enrolled mages at the school and professors who work there. A large sum of money comes yearly from the Uchon Popular Emissary. The newest popular emissary, Yarjin Saqull, has recently bolstered the Institute with funding, much to the disliking of the simple minded Slaver Halflings that typically dominate the polls of Uchon. 

All professors at the Institute vote on large decisions to send a recommendation of action to the headmaster. However, since the [[Gold Tear Gang]] attack, he has "suspended" the votes. 

Headmaster Benkirk Behegu was a human man in his young 50s. Behegu, a selfish and greedy man, devised a plan to find himself more powerful than ever before. He contracted a small time bandit group from [[Consteltown, Crua Clye]] called the [[Gold Tear Gang]] to raid and storm the Institute, causing havoc and stealing magic items. Unfortunately, some of the grunts from the [[Gold Tear Gang]] went overboard and started killing. 

Soon after the raid, Headmaster Behegu started pushing policies of stronger securities and more strict control of magic items. With a sense of fear among the school, the headmaster gained strong support. 

Knowing that [[Farpip Darkback]] has been missing since the raid, and assuming he is trying to learn who is behind the raid, has started spreading rumors about Pip amongst the current class of students, such that Pip is a dropout, unintelligent, and has been expelled from the Institute for illegal activities such as treason.  

Most recently, Behegu has once again contracted the [[Gold Tear Gang]] to attack once again.

After [[Motley Crew]]'s arrival to the Institute, the [[Gold Tear Gang]] and evil wizards that turned on their own were eradicated, leaving the [[Arcane Autonomy]] to reform the leadership.
