## Overview
[[Clan Tigfum]] is a clan of Cloud Giants that has been around for thousands and thousands of years. Drifting from place to place, they only stay docked to one mountain for about a decade or two before they move on with the wind.

## The People
The [[Clan Tigfum]] Cloud Giants are a good people. They live peacefully among the clouds, rarely making contact with the humanoids on the ground below unless they feel an itch to trade or defend the people against a terrible threat, however, they often expect some form of payment when this is the case.

## The Leadership
King Dithos III is the third of his direct bloodline to be the king of the cloud giants. He has a long time rivalry against the King Bumalog line of the Stone Giants in the [[Dark Forest, Uncharted Territory|Dark Forest]].Â 

The man of the Tigfum family is the King of the castle. King Dithos III is an old cloud giant, and his ancestors lived to be old too. The Dithos chain of Tigfums despise the Bumalog chain of the Stone Giants in the [[Dark Forest, Uncharted Territory|Dark Forest]]. The hatred is supposed to have spawned from an old rivalry between the firsts of their names when Dithos Tigfum showed up to the Dark Forest to claim tributes. They say that Bumalog refused to grant Dithos a human sized barrel of honey the Stone Giants had raided from a trader on the road parallel to the [[Dark Forest, Uncharted Territory|Dark Forest]].
