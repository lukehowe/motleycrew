## Overview
The Dark Forest is a deep, dark expanse of tall, dark leaved trees that runs up and down the west border of [[Crua Clye]]. It consists of relatively normal forest features, but the fact that it hosts several evil monsters makes it a special forest. The leaves of the tree canopy nearly block out all sunlight within this forest.Â 

The Dark Forest is mainly unmapped and unexplored; most explorers that ventured into the region never returned. The majority of those that have returned, did so changed. Their adventurous spirit had been extinguished, and they never wanted to return to the Forest.
