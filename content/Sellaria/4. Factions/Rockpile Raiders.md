Rockpile Raiders
Location: [[Goblin Fields, Uchon]]
Allies: [[Motley Crew]], [[Holy Army of Trithereon]]
Enemies: [[Crashing Wave Clan]]
Members: Wrang (leader, hobgoblin), Urt, Ooz (Rock priest)

## Overview
A clan similar to the [[Crimson Marauders]], who have probably raided each other at some point. They find themselves aligned following the [[Crashing Wave Clan]]'s atrocities, coming together because of the [[Holy Army of Trithereon]].

The clan's original founding purpose is to take the All Knowing Rock to its resting place. Its tunnel was originally present within the Crystal Caverns in the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon|Goblin Fields]], but after the Underdark tunnels started moving, they became cut off. Now, the Rock tells Ooz that the direction to the resting place is south of the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon|Goblin Fields]].
