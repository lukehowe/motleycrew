Location: [[Crua Clye]]
Leader: [[Boron]]
Allies: [[Motley Crew]]
Enemies: [[Froiji Supremacy]]
Members: Mar Chumen

## Overview
Formerly known as the Crimson Lions. [[Boron]] and this faction defeated the stellar monsters from Sandcrater where [[Craterholm, Crua Clye||Craterholm]] now lies. Bayron Jaiross, the father of [[King Kayron Jaiross]], ordered the [[Royal Meteorite Longsword of Mayron]] be made for his son Mayron Jaiross, rather than [[Boron]], who traditionally should have received the artifact for his work clearing the crater.

The Mosquitos then turned to crime to stick it to the Royal Family after this betrayal.

Sometime after, the [[Illithilich]] took control of this faction, using its members to collect gold, the Meteorite artifacts, and blood for its lichdom ritual. First, the [[Royal Meteorite Longsword of Mayron]] disappeared out from underneath [[Okirk]], an unknown Mosquito stole the [[Meteorite Longsword of Ziod-Kaz]] from [[Treecrater, Crua Clye]], and then Mar Chumen stole the [[Meteorite Longbow of Gormon]] from [[Castle Stormwatch, Crua Clye]]. 

Following the Comet Collision, now that the [[Illithilich]] is done with the Mosquitos, he has released them from his control. After meeting with the [[Motley Crew]] in the deserts outside of [[Craterholm, Crua Clye]], [[Boron]] has been convinced to fight with them and the [[Royal Army]] in the upcoming war on the terms that [[Boron]] receives the [[Royal Meteorite Longsword of Mayron]] that was rightfully his.

## Motivations & Goals
The Star Bandits original motivation and goals were to steal, rob, and become rich and gain the recognition they deserve after fighting the Sandcrater stellar monsters and being disrepected by Bayron Jaiross. Their plan was brought to a grinding halt after a nefarious force - the [[Illithilich]] took over their faction. He then used the Mosquitos to gather the materials he needed for his lichdom ritual.
