Arcane Autonomy
Location: [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon]]
Leader: Orrick Paletwist (Student), Rathan Valran (new Headmaster)
Allies: [[Motley Crew]]

## Overview
Arcane Autonomy was born from a group of mages that wanted to free the school from Benkirk Behegu's grasp over arcana and return it to its previously mainly autonomous nature following the [[Gold Tear Gang]] Attack and [[Farpip Darkback]]'s Fare. 

When the [[Gold Tear Gang]] sprung their second attack, the Autonomy was ready. They defend the school and also joined the [[Motley Crew]] in battling the Board of Magical Security as they move inwards towards Behegu's Quarters. 

Following the Second Battle for the Institute, the Autonomy reformed the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon||Institute]]'s leadership to be more safe/fair.
