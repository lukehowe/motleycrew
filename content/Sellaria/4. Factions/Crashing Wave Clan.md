## Overview
A faction of Goblin raiders that started capturing their own kind and selling them to others.  The Crashing Wave Clan used to be an admirable group of fearless goblins that participated in faction warfare against the [[Crimson Marauders]], until they eventually turned leaf and began capturing the [[Crimson Marauders]] and other goblin clans and selling them to the Uchon [[Slaver's Guild]] in a scheme to get rich. The [[Froiji Supremacy]] got involved with this plot, specifically Paeris Ianric, who was doing research on the goblin slaves, turning them into Drones. Within months, the Crashing Wave Clan was known to be a dirty group of evil goblins. They eventually captured the majority of the goblins in the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon||Goblin Fields]] and [[Plux]], the group's disgusting leader, decided their next move would be to move to the [[Froiji Supremacy]], where they planned to enslave more goblins and sell them to the [[Circle of Dragonriders]].
