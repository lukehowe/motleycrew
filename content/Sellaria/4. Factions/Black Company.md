## Overview
A faction that was aboard the same boat as the [[Motley Crew]] that entered [[Wheatvil, Crua Clye]] in 1500 A.B. After being left stranded on the boat by the [[Motley Crew]], and then being overshadowed by the [[Motley Crew]]'s accomplishments at the Sun Tower led to a quick rivalry developing.

They packed up and left [[Wheatvil, Crua Clye]] shortly after the [[Motley Crew]].

After arriving in [[Frontiertown, Crua Clye]], the Black Company takes side jobs delivering mail to acquire coin. Here, [[Lydie Holyspell]] tells [[Vorax]] about the Company's plans to sabotage the [[Motley Crew]] out of jealousy. After the Crew finds Zubar Cammol and breaks up the drug ring in the city, the Black Company gets stranded in [[Frontiertown, Crua Clye]] to search the mail for drugs.

The Black Company makes it to [[Nohull, Crua Clye]] and leaves the same day for [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]]. They set up a trap on the road between the cities for the [[Motley Crew]]. In that skirmish on the road, the black Human fighter with the Company is killed. The green Dragonborn wizard casted Fly and escaped with the half elf woman and dwarf man. [[Lydie Holyspell]] joins the [[Motley Crew]] until making it to Jaiross, where she goes off on her own.

Sometime during the [[Motley Crew]]'s excursion into the [[Glimmersea]], the Black Company presumedly arrived in [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]] and took advantage of the chaos following the comet collision to get into the Crag Keep Dungeon and release the ex-Master of War, Ilbryen Gilcan, who was arrested after being caught by the [[Motley Crew]], and perhaps more...?

Sometime after this, the Company built a treehouse hideout in a small forest outside of [[Westbridge, Crua Clye]], making contact with the [[Froiji Supremacy]] and striking an information deal. Soon thereafter, the [[Motley Crew]] attacked, and the Black Company fled to [[Westbridge, Crua Clye]] to meet with their Froijan agents, and haven't been seen since.

## Leader
Laxed Brenzavur seems to lead the Company for all intents and purposes.

## Motivations & Goals
The goal of the Company seems to be the end of the [[Motley Crew]].
