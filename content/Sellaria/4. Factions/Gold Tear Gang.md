## Overview
The Gold Tear Gang was a group that was organized within the city of [[Consteltown, Crua Clye]] around 1370 A.B. Because their founding was prior to the organization of the [[Royal Army]], the group was formed under contract by the throne to protect and defend [[Consteltown, Crua Clye||Consteltown]], the [[Gold Tear]], and the construction effort while research was done to see if the [[Gold Tear]] could somehow super charge or power the observatory telescope. 

Aside from the occasional monster attack, the [[Gold Tear]] had it relatively easy. They sat around within the cave that housed the [[Gold Tear]], admiring it, protecting it, and forming a strong brotherhood. When citizens eventually began to live around the constructed observatory, they began to earn favor with them too, whether it be occasionally travelling with a wagon caravan and defending it from attacks, or helping an old grandmother find her children on the outskirts of town. 

However, several decades later, after the capital was constructed, [[Nohull, Crua Clye]] had also been founded, and eventually overtook Consteltown on its astronomical prowess.  After this, the funding for the contract for the [[Gold Tear]] was cut, and [[Royal Army||Royal Knights]] were sent down to protect the city. However, the Gold Tear Gang stuck around. With the lack of funding coming in, the faction ultimately opted for small crime to earn its gold. However, they knew they could not risk their relationship with the citizens of [[Consteltown, Crua Clye||Consteltown]], so they targeted desolate roads away from the city. 

More recently, [[Headmaster Behegu]] of the [[Uchon Institute of Learning, Uchon]] had reached out to contract [[Zane Redstream]] and the Gold Tear Gang to attack the Institute. Behegu, wanting to obtain more power over the artifacts the Institute has to offer, and knowing of Zane's past, chose him as the merc to carry out the attack. 

Behegu, unimpressed with the increase of his control following the raid, has paid the Gold Tear Gang to once again, attack the Institute.

Some of the Gold Tear Gang was destroyed when the [[Motley Crew]] arrived at [[Consteltown, Crua Clye||Consteltown]], and the remainder was destroyed at the Second Battle of the Institute.
