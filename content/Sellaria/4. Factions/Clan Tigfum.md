## Overview
The Clan Tigfum Cloud Giants are a good people. They live peacefully among the clouds, rarely making contact with the humanoids on the ground below unless they feel an itch to trade or defend the people against a terrible threat, however, they often expect some form of payment when this is the case.

Following the [[Motley Crew]]'s participation in the Raid on the Bumalogs in the [[Dark Forest, Uncharted Territory]], the clan has given the [[Motley Crew]] a favor to redeem.
