## Overview
Created in 1204 A.B by the [[Acla|Aclan]] Governor, the Slaveholder's Guild has been around for a long time. The purpose of the guild was to ensure an [[Uchon|Uchonian]] citizen's right to practice slavery, and was backed by the [[Acla|Aclan]] government. However, after the Forown Fray, and the succession from [[Acla]], the guild was twisted and turned into an institution built off of hatred, torture, and prejudice. They flooded funding into the squads that were venturing into the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon|Goblin Fields]], and the sickening capture and torture of the goblins was applauded from within the faction. 

The clan holds a yearly convention where the leader travels to [[Verdantstead, Uchon]] and speaks to the halflings about their cause and their plans to keep the guild and the practice of slavery respected and kept in the nation. 

It is important to note that the [[Uchon|Uchonian]] slaveholders mentality is often backed by the false rationalization and justification that "the goblins attacked us first."
