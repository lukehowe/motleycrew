Crimson Marauders
Location: Unknown
Leader: Ordek (Hobgoblin)
Enemies: [[Crashing Wave Clan]]
Members: Ordek (Hobgoblin), [[Drex]], [[Slyzz]], [[Bluz]]

## Overview
The Crimson Marauders raided throughout the [[Goblin Fields, Uchon]] until one night, the [[Crashing Wave Clan]] surprise attacked them and captured a large majority of their goblins for slavery.

When [[Bluz]] and the [[Motley Crew]] returned to this spot, it was unclear where the remaining Marauders went, but it seemed there was heavy foot traffic throughout the area.
