## Overview
The Circle of Dragonriders is the council that runs the [[Froiji Supremacy]]. It is a group of 5 dragonriders. The Froiji are very powerful and believe in something called "Froiji Logic" which says that if you are powerful enough to kill something, you should.

Olofrix flew to Crua Clye and laid eggs around Jaiross in 1500 A.B., and her offspring Rhyshox attacked the Motley Crew and was killed, leading to strong tensions between Crua Clye and [[Froiji Supremacy]]. 

The Circle took in the [[Black Company]] as informants against the [[Motley Crew]].

Soon after the Motley Crew arrived to the Breadbasket in Uchon, they discovered that Paeris Ianric, Inventor of Froiji and 'The Maker' had cracked an alliance with the Slave's Guild and the Crashing Wave Clan, with Vr'a'th's approval, and was capturing/using goblin slaves to create Drones, a type of braindead servant with psionic laser abilities (batshit, right?). He counter-attacked the [[Motley Crew]] while they raided [[Glowsky Shoulder, Uchon]] with the [[Holy Army of Trithereon]], leading to the death of his dragon, Erdin. He mysteriously teleported away thereafter.
