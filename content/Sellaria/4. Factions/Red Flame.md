## Overview
Around 1480 A.B., the Red Flame attacked [[Aramuss Keep, Uchon]], killing [[Vorax]]'s family and people.

The Red Flame hired [[Garit Kog]] in 1500 A.B. as a contractor to broker mercenaries to go into the [[Glimmersea]] and search for allies (Drow? Mind Flayers?).

After [[Garit Kog]]'s death became commonplace knowledge in [[Crua Clye]], [[Rhenad]] sent an army of mercenaries to [[Jaiross, Capital of Crua Clye]] to look for the [[Motley Crew]]. Their arrival came in time for the collision of the Fortune Comet, which better leveraged their takeover of the city. And with the [[Glimmersea]] rumored to being close to the capital because of the [[Motley Crew]]'s disappearance, the Red Flame had even better reason to occupy it. They then roamed the streets and tortured citizens, hoping to find information regarding the [[Motley Crew]]'s whereabouts. After failing to find the [[Motley Crew]] for some time and being countered by the [[Froiji Supremacy]], the Red Flame ultimately pulled out, going back into moving in the shadows.

Now that the Red Flame has resurfaced again, they have spent their away time wisely - they return with [[Garit Kog]], once again, this time with a new power involving an Illithid tadpole from the Underdark, likely [[Glimmersea]]. They also walk with Drow. It seems that these movements have disturbed some of the Ring of Rhenad's lieutenants - such as Elel Aldaviel.
