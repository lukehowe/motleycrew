This trip is more exciting than I ever could have dreamed. After the damned politics and the robbery of the [[Royal Meteorite Longsword of Mayron||Meteorite Sword]] commissioned for Prince Mayron, this trip is what I needed. Yes, the nation will have to go for a while without a weapon being smelted by the world famous [[Okirk]], the Meteorite Blacksmith, however, my old master always talked about the site and what it could do to the cosmic steel. I have taken a sample of what was left from Sandcrater that should have been applied to the unfinished Royal Longsword, hoping to prepare myself a Meteorite pendant.
