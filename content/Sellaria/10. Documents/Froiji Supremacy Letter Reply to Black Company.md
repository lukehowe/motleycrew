Laxed, 

Your letter has piqued my interest, and I must admit that your proposition intrigues me. The [[Motley Crew]] has indeed caused us numerous troubles in the past, such as murdering my grand dragon Rhyshox, as well as murdering numerous of our brave men fighting for the [[Froiji Supremacy||Froiji]] way, and any insight you can provide to ensure their downfall would be of immense value. However, the [[Motley Crew]] has not been spotted for some time. The rumors say they are dead, but a party with their strength and cunning is surely not gone for long. Their direct location would be much better Intel to bargain with. 

I am willing to grant you a conditional pardon, subject to the validity and accuracy of the information you provide. If your intelligence proves true and aids us in dealing with the [[Motley Crew]], you shall find yourself absolved of your past transgressions, whatever they may be. 

There will be a pair of agents in the Leaky Loo tavern and inn in [[Westbridge, Crua Clye||Westbridge]] when you arrive. They will assure your safe delivery to [[Efona, Froiji Supremacy||Efona]]. 

Rest assured, I value loyalty and results, and I expect you to deliver on your promises. Failure to do so will have dire consequences for you and your prospects for pardon. 

Choose your path wisely, Laxed, for this opportunity may lead to redemption or ruin. 

Sincerely, 

[[Vr'a'th]], Supreme Leader of Froiji 

& 

Grosof Bosk, Diplomat of Froiji
