Sometimes, Illithids have been known to go "rogue" from their Elder Brain. Sometimes this may be because the Elder Brain "evicts" the Illithid from their colony, due to something like practicing arcane magic, which is considered foreign and weak to a psionic being. It is thought that if an Elder Brain is destroyed, all of its illithids would become rogue. It is known that when a rogue illithid dies while it is disconnected from its Elder Brain, it will be drained of its color, turning into a shade of pasty white.
