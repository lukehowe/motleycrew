Hello, 

I know you all don't recognize my name, and that is my fault. My name is Gwendolyn - I lived in [[Frontiertown, Crua Clye||Frontiertown]] when your party came through. I owe you all a huge debt - for clearing the drug problem in my town, and saving me from it. My daughter will have a life now. My village is prospering again, and things are looking up. A Kenku and his family named Flusher showed up, and he helps everyone around the village. He speaks highly of your camp, too. Keep doing good. The world needs it. 

Gwendolyn
