*in elven*

Entry One:  

[[Vr'a'th]] only got this far because of his connections, not because of real talent. He is just lucky to be Supreme Leader. 

Zog is a fierce warrior and deserves title of Guardian, but it’s clear that he is still an amateur. His dragon is weak and wild, too. 

Grosof Bosk’s diplomatic skills are surprisingly competent for someone with such limited experience. 

Orist Erxina, Wizard of [[Froiji Supremacy||Froiji]], is obviously heavily influenced by my earlier work, and when I tackle similar problems, I actually find elegant solutions.    

Entry Two:  

Bringing in the [[Slaver's Guild]] and [[Crashing Wave Clan]] as Allies to the [[Froiji Supremacy||Froiji]] is the smartest thing I have came up with in a long time. [[Vr'a'th]] is satisfied with the prospect of a practically undead super knight army, and I am satisfied with my little experiments. 

Entry Three:  

[[Vr'a'th]] has once again ordered me to halt my experiments to begin meteorite research. It bores me. Space rock, so cool. I want to create something brand new, not make old tools from space rock. The one thing that is exciting to me, and I am interested to see - whoever currently holds the Three Meteorite Artifacts of [[Crua Clye]] will directly control its future. 

Entry Four:  

The increase in temperature around this region is astounding. As I fly in on Erdin, I can feel it increasing, even at night as I fly. Could it be the rumored site…?
