To my dearest apprentice, [[Farpip Darkback]], 

I find it fitting to entrust unto you, Pip, two of my favorite items, both of them brimming with tales of adventures and mystique, which I eagerly wait to share with you. First is, the Deck of Many More Things. It is a deck of magical cards that grant the user a magical effect. It is very important for me to stress to you, Farpip, that this deck is no toy. It can be extremely dangerous. I will tell you more soon. Secondly is my Bracers of Defense. They are key to ensuring your safety in martial combat. I've dodged many a blade with the magic gifted from these bracers. Both of these items are hidden beneath an illusory panel in the far corner of the room. 

Your tireless pursuit of knowledge, your mischievous yet endearing nature, and your unyielding loyalty have not gone unnoticed. In you, I see the spark of a true wizard, and I am filled with pride at the mage you have become. As you embark on your own journey, may these items serve you as faithful companions, and may the arcane energies that course through them guide you to greatness. Remember, Farpip, the magic within you is as boundless as the starlit sky. 

With utmost respect and affection, 

Professor Adrugeor
