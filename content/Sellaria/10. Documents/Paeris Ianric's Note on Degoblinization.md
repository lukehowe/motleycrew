The de-goblin-ization tests are showing great promise. It seems they are truly not aware of who they are once the conversion is complete … However, with my aide reports and my own experimentation - it appears that the test group within the [[Froiji Supremacy||Froiji]] state are much more promising. Perhaps it has to do  with this being so close to their homeland. The test group here within the Breadbasket can still be awoken from their slumber… perhaps my Pain Gauntlet will change that once it is fully constructed. These goblins will continue to scratch my itch to experiment, and please [[Vr'a'th]] once they become the undefeatable foes I know they will. Part of me wants to never crack it… it means [[Vr'a'th]] taking my fun from me…
