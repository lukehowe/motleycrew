Motley Crew, 

It felt weird addressing the letter as that. It was only a few weeks ago you four were friends of mine looking for work - but now you are all heroes. I'm glad it was obvious from the start I wasn't fit for adventure. I'm sure you guys have been in real danger since that day in the field near the Sun Tower. I reminisce it daily. In the meantime, I met the baker's daughter here in [[Wheatvil, Crua Clye||Wheatvil]]. I think she's the one. I reckon I'll spend my days here, or at least on this side of the world. Who knows how far you all will go. Don't forget me, as I will never forget you all. 

Be safe, and don't get killed,
