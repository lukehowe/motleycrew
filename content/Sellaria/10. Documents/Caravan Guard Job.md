"Attention all, 

The Royal Family is reaching out to the country of [[Uchon]] looking to recruit four fit men to act as guards for a caravan of wagons distributing foodstuff amongst the cities of our country. A boat chartered by the Royalty will arrive on the western shore of [[Uchon]] in a fortnight. If you wish to be examined for this job, ride on this ship to [[Crua Clye]] and make your way north to [[Wheatvil, Crua Clye|Wheatvil]] to find Royal Caravan Advisor Aeson. He is running a small trial to select the four guards. This job will be well paid, so the four best men will be picked. 

Signed, [[King Kayron Jaiross]]"
