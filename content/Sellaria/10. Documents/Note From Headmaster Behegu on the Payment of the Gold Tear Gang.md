[[Zane Redstream||Zane]], you remember we agreed to 10000 gold pieces for the first attack. I know you want the Efreeti Bottle. I've done some arranging since that demon [[Farpip Darkback||Farpip]] left. It will be here for your next attack. Consider that cloak just a gift. I eagerly await to see the chaos.Â
