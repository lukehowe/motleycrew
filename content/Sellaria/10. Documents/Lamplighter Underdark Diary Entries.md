dad,  

it is our eigth day in this hell hole. we decided to head east after we couldn't find the [[Dark Forest, Uncharted Territory||dark forest]] cavern we used as the entrance. we've been communicating our worries to [[Garit Kog||garit]] - he tells us to keep going. 

it seems he's forgotten that all of us expect to get back up to the sunlight, and with no way out, morale is low. earlier today two of the guys started fighting about rations, stupid shit. Keep praying, pa

dad, 

day 9, that damn entrance had to have moved. I remember the cave etching next to where we entered, and next to it was stone. 

More fights, encountered a friendly fish man. Morlen succumbed to his injury, RIP – Uriro
