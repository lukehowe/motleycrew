[[Froiji Supremacy]], 

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits, as it is written with an urgent proposition that might interest you greatly. As a wizard of some repute, I find myself entangled with a rival adventuring group known as the [[Motley Crew]], agents and puppets of the Crown of [[Crua Clye]]. They have been a thorn in my side for far too long, and I now seek an opportunity to gain favor with you, the formidable leader of our neighboring country. 

In exchange for a full pardon for me and my party’s past actions, I offer you invaluable information about the [[Motley Crew]]’s movements, strategies, and potential weaknesses. My knowledge of their tactics and inner workings runs deep, and I assure you that this information can provide you with a significant advantage over them in any future encounters. 

I understand the gravity of my request, and I am prepared to prove my loyalty through deeds, should you find my offer worthy of consideration. The [[Motley Crew]] has thwarted many of our ambitions, and their defeat will undoubtedly strengthen your country’s  position in the region. 

Please consider this proposal carefully, and if you find it agreeable, let us meet discreetly to discuss the specifics of our alliance. This letter comes to you from [[Craterholm, Crua Clye||Craterholm]], just 3 days after the disastrous comet collision. We plan to move to [[Westbridge, Crua Clye||Westbridge]] soon. 

With utmost respect, 

Laxed, the [[Black Company]] Mage
