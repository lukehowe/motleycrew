Entry 1: Just earlier today I met the most fascinating man. A man with the surname Cammol. I typically find myself spending my time with the most vile men around - one of the few things I can do to entertain myself in this boring life. He gave me what he called Sunburn, a special herb mixture his brother used to make. It gave me the most euphoric high. He told me he could make my life more entertaining than ever before. 

Entry 2, just a few days later: That foul bitch Serenity Starsk. I have given her coin after coin and done nothing but be there for her. How can she not see I am the one for her? She needs to love me. She will love me. She needs to stop acting like she doesn't love me. She wants me more than I want her. 

Entry 3, just two days later: Fashir Cammol , or Lord Alaric as I should call him, as finally left the city to me. He took 3 of our servants with him; that's fine. Soon enough, this entire city will serve me. I'm more powerful than Walter will ever be. And once I reunite with Lord Alaric in Willowdale, we will be more powerful than the entire realm.
