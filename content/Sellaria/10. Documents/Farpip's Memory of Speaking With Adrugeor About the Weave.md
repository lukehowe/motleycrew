[[Farpip Darkback]] remembers looking into the wise eyes of Adrugeor after a long evening of studying arcana. In the candle lit interior of Adrugeor's chamber, the gnome's wise master's eyes shimmered. 

"Some question where the arcane energy we use comes from." He twisted his wand, the long wooden stick of what could be miniature, twisted tree roots. "There are some that believe in what they call The Weave. It is said to be an interface between the material plane and the raw arcane energy we manipulate. Not quite another plane, but close." Adrugeor continued. 

"Do you believe in it?" Farpip asked his master, eager to learn from the man who mentored him, fighting through the impending fatigue setting in from the long day prior to this conversation. 

"I believe we can visit it." Adrugeor softly said. "Perhaps even manipulate The Weave itself, pulling its strings to harness the raw arcana in a way we see fit. I'm working on a theory, you see. If there were to be a powerful relic resting in one place for a long time, I wonder if it could weigh on The Weave, ripping a hole through it, exposing itself to the material plane - ah, nevermind, young Farpip. It is much too late for this conversation. We shall continue another time. Anyways, I have a rather important letter to write." Adrugeor reaches for a nearby inkwell and quill. "Goodnight, young Farpip. I am proud of the mage you are becoming." 

The next day, the Institute was attacked.
