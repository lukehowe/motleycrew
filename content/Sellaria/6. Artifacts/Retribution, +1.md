+1 Weapon (Longsword), rare (Requires attunement) 

Once the poisoned blade of [[Gnatface]], but now a weapon of freedom blessed by Trithereon, wielded by [[Bluz]]. 

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing radiant light to erupt from the blade. These lights shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the sword is shining, it deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage to any target it hits. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword. 

An imperfect, long blade, having small deviations in the straight form of its sharpness, with a pumice stone appearance with a green poison dripping out of its vesicles, now of course altered by Trithereon’s blessing to take on a bright steel silver appearance with radiant light emerging from the vesicles.
