+2 Weapon (Longsword), rare (Requires attunement)Â 

Trithereon's personal weapon, gifted to [[Vorax]].

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing radiant light to erupt from the blade. These lights shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the sword is shining, it deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage to any target it hits. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
